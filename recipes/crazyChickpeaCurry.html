    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon coconut oil
        <li>1 medium yellow onion, thinly sliced
        <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced
        <li>2 tablespoons mild curry powder
        <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes
        <li>2½ cups vegetable broth
        <li>2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce or tamari
        <li>2 tablespoons pure maple syrup
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste
        <li>¾ pound Yukon Gold potatoes, cut into 3/4-inch pieces
        <li>1 large carrot, sliced diagonally 1/4 inch thick
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can chickpeas, rinsed and drained         
        <li>1 cup coconut milk        
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro, plus more for garnish          
        <li>½ cup frozen peas         
        <li>Salt to taste         
        <li>Cooked basmati rice     
        <li>1 tablespoon Sriracha chile sauce             
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt coconut oil in a heavy 4-quart pot over medium heat. Saute onion until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add ginger and garlic and saute until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add curry powder, pepper flakes, broth, soy sauce, maple syrup, and tomato paste and stir.
        <li>In a large bowl, use your hands to mix together the chopped jalapenos, ground beef, salt, pepper, egg, steak sauce, onion, hot pepper sauce, oregano, Worcestershire sauce, garlic salt and Fritos®. Divide into 8 balls, and flatten into patties.
        <li>Remove from heat and season with salt, if needed. Serve with steamed basmati rice and, for those who'd like more heat, sriracha sauce. Garnish with cilantro.
